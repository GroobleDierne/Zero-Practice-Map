### Zero Cycle Practice Map

> Forked from Astraf and Nayoar's practice map

This is an updated version of the map that fixes issues and adds some features.

# Changes

- Up to 3 configurable inventory presets.
- Moved a platform that prevented reading the O value on buried islands.
- Saturation is no longer exaggerated, it is equivalent to a hunger reset.
- Advancements related to dragon fight are reset after each end fight for AA runners.
- Hotbar is no longer messed up sometimes and items truly keep the same place as laid out in the chest.
- More blocks are cleared when the island is reset (nether bricks, dirt, coarse dirt, gravel, soul sand...).
- The pressure plate can be changed to any material if you don't like the noise the default one makes.
